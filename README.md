[![justforfunnoreally.dev badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/justforfunnoreally-dev-9ff)](https://justforfunnoreally.dev)

Callisto is a reverse Polish notation programming language, inspired by YSL-C3 and
Forth. It also includes a subset called CallistoScript, designed for compiling to
scripting languages like Lua, while still maintaining a relatively low-level approach.

## Supported Targets 

- **x86 Real Mode, MS-DOS:** Fully supported
- **x86_64 Linux, macOS:** Fully supported
- **ARM64 Linux, macOS:** Fully supported
- **Uxn:** Fully supported
- **Lua:** Fully supported (subset: CallistoScript)

## Build Instructions

To build the Callisto compiler, you will need a
[D compiler](https://dlang.org/download.html). Once installed, build the project using
the following command:

```
dub build
```

## Getting Started

### Running Example Programs

Before running example programs, ensure that the `std` submodule is included in your
repository. You can achieve this by cloning the repository recursively or running the
following command:

```
git submodule update --init --remote --recursive
```

Example programs are located in the `examples` directory. To compile and run an example,
use:

```
cac examples/<exampleName>.cal -i std -o out
./out
```
