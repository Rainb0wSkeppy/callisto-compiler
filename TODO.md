# TODO
- For loops
- Make if/while have a scope
- move global constructor calls to let statement
- Make constructors and destructors work on aliased and inherited types
- I think renamed externs are broken?

## Pointers
Functions `CompileFuncDef`, `CompileLet`, `CompileArray`, `CompileExtern` must be updated
- Add support for them when using constructors and destructors
